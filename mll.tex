\section{Correctness for MLL+MIX with \textsf{cut}}




\begin{theorem}
    Let \( \pi \) be a proof structure for \textsf{MLL+MIX+CUT}.
    It is correct if and only if the interpretation \( \sem{\pi}_{|\varrho|} \) in \( \ProfCat \) is coherent for every assignemnt \( \varrho \) of groupoids with coherence.
    % An \textsf{MLL} proof structure (without unit) satisfies the creed-kit criterion if and only if it is a correct proof-net for \textsf{MLL+MIX}.
    A similar statement holds for the totality.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    The left-to-right direction is obvious since the tight orthogonality category is \( * \)-autonomous~\cite{Hyland2003}.\tk{to do: details, e.g., page and lem/prop numbers}
\end{proof}
