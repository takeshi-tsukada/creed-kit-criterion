\section{Towards a Criterion for MLL}

A \emph{positive good element} is inductively defined as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item For \( \creed \otimes \creedb \): a pair of positive good elements
    \item For \( \creed \llpar \creedb \): a pair of a positive good element and a negative good element
\end{itemize}
A \emph{negative good element} is inductively defined as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item For \( \creed \otimes \creedb \): a pair of a negative good element and a positive good element
    \item For \( \creed \llpar \creedb \): a pair of negative good elements
\end{itemize}

A profunctor is \emph{good} if it contains a good element in its creed.
(Equivalently, the stabiliser group of every element contains a good element.)

\begin{conjecture}
    An MLL proof structure (without unit) satisfies the strict creed-kit criterion if and only if it is a correct proof-net for MLL.
\end{conjecture}
