\section{Correctness for \textsf{MLL+MIX} without Cut}

\tk{to do: give an interpretation of MLL proof structure.  Show the coherence by giving a direct interpretation (= \emph{experiments}) and comparing it with the standard interpretation}

An \emph{assignment} \( \varrho \) is a mapping from propositional variables to groupoids.

\begin{theorem}
    Let \( \pi \) be a cut-free proof structure for \textsf{MLL+MIX} (without unit).
    It is correct if and only if the interpretation \( \sem{\pi}_\varrho \) in \( \mathbf{Prof} \) satisfies the kit-creed criterion for every \( \varrho \).
    % An \textsf{MLL} proof structure (without unit) satisfies the creed-kit criterion if and only if it is a correct proof-net for \textsf{MLL+MIX}.
\end{theorem}


\begin{theorem}
    An MLL proof structure (without unit) \( \pi \) is a correct proofnet for MLL + MIX if and only if, for every substitution \( \vartheta \) of propositional variables in \( \pi \) and every correct proof-net \( \pi' \), \( \rsem{\mathsf{cut}(\pi\vartheta, \pi')} = \MatTrans{\sem{\mathsf{cut}(\pi\vartheta, \pi')}} \). 
\end{theorem}

\tk{to do: creed-kit criterion for non-cut-free proof structures}

\begin{corollary}
    \( \MatTrans{\sem{\pi}} = \rsem{\pi} \) for every sequent calculus proof \( \pi \) of LL + MIX.
\end{corollary}
\begin{corollary}
    \( \MatTrans{\sem{\pi}} = \rsem{\pi} \) for a correct MLL + MIX proof \( \pi \). 
\end{corollary}



\section{Correctness for \textsf{MLL+MIX} with \textsf{cut}}
Let \( G \) be the slack orthogonality category, where \( f \orthogonal g \) if and only if \( g \circ f = \ident_I \) and this pair satisfies the jointly freeness condition.

\begin{theorem}
    Let \( \pi \) be a proof structure for \textsf{MLL+MIX} possibly with cut but without unit.
    It is correct if and only if the interpretation \( \sem{\pi}_\varrho \) in \( \mathbf{Prof} \) is a morphism in the slack orthogonality category \( G \) for every \( \varrho \).
    % An \textsf{MLL} proof structure (without unit) satisfies the creed-kit criterion if and only if it is a correct proof-net for \textsf{MLL+MIX}.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    The left-to-right direction is obvious since the slack orthogonality category is \( * \)-autonomous~\cite{Hyland2003}.\tk{to do: page}
\end{proof}
