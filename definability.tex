\section{Full completeness?}
Try to give a full completeness result.
It suffices to find a class of profunctors that can be obtained as an interpretation of proof-structure (not necessarily correct).
Then this condition together with the creed-kit criterion gives a characterisation of denotations of correct proof-structures.

\begin{theorem}
    \tk{Conjecture.  Even the statement is not concrete, as the notion of ``family'' has not yet formally given.}
    Every family of profunctors (that takes values in the slack orthogonality category) is definable.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    The slack orthogonality category can be mapped to the category of totality spaces, and a family is mapped to a family.
    By the definability of families of totality spaces~\cite{Loader1994}, there exists a bijection \( \varphi \) such that \( F[\vec{A}](a_1,\dots,a_n) \neq \emptyset \) if and only if \( a_i \cong a_{\varphi(i)} \) for every \( i \).
\end{proof}
